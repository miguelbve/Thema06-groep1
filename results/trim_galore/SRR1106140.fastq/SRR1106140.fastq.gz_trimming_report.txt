Trim Galore version: 0.6.6
Cutadapt version: 3.1
Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 4). Second best hit was Illumina (count: 0)
Adapter sequence: 'CTGTCTCTTATA' (Nextera Transposase sequence; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length before a sequence gets removed: 20 bp
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Running FastQC with the following extra arguments: --outdir ../results/trim_galore/SRR1106140.fastq
Output file will be GZIP compressed
